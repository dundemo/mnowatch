jsssdeep.html:<!-- TO DO: Also implement and/or special syntax inside a single filter and not only between two or more filters   -->
mnowatch.sh:#TO DO: The mnowatch report of individuality does not take into account the crowdnode type of masternodes, and it wrongly assumes that a crowdnode is a unique individual.
mnowatch.sh:#TO DO: Make the script intedendant of dashcentral.org api. Read directly the active proposals by using dash-cli
mnowatch.sh:#TO DO: Use this payee address to do more smart groupings
mnowatch.sh:#TO DO: After spork 15 the payee is not valid, we should check collateraladdress
mnowatch.sh:#TO DO: debug git diff --color-words. It seems to put some IPs in the same line while we expect to be in separete lines.
mnowatch.sh:#TO DO: debug ansi2html when looks like a table.
mnowatch.sh:#TO DO: If git_diff is empty do not create a link of it in index.html, but rathere present the simple diff (which will contain the new IPs that appeared  who didnt vote at all,  but caused the new report to be triggered)
mnowatch.sh:#TO DO: insert in every line the VOTEHASH as the keyword of the row <tr id=$VOTEHASH>. (how to do it without looping? maybe by using the command paste)
ssdeepit.sh:#TO DO: make every proposal link to dashwatch https://dashwatchbeta.org/api/p/proposal_name

ssdeepit.sh:#TO DO: show the dash address of every masternode, and link it to an OP_RETURN service so that people can send him messages.
ssdeepit.sh:#TO DO: CALCULATE ALSO THE IP similarities. This will apply mostly to the whale whose IP set  differ +- 1 or 2 masternodes.
ssdeepit.sh:#TO DO: So in case we have the same votes set and the IPs are similar, it is probable the same individual
